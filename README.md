# cltl-kyoto-scripts
Miscellaneous scripts on kyoto.let.vu.nl.

The scripts can be found in the `bin` directory. They are documented in `cltl_kyoto_scripts.pdf`.
Both scripts and documentation can be re-generated using [nuweb](http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/) and LaTeX.
To do that, install nuweb and then perform:

- `make sources` to re-generate the scripts;
- `make pdf` to re-generate `cltl_kyoto_scripts.pdf`
- `make html` to generate the documentation as html in subdirectory html.
